.TP
\fB\fIco\fB\fR
A pointer to an existing collective group.

A 64-bit work request identifier that is returned
to the client as part of the work completion.
.TP
\fB\fIroot\fB\fR
The rank of the member receiving the data.
.TP
\fB\fIsrc_ds\fB\fR
A reference to a local data segment describing the
source buffer.  This parameter may be NULL at the
root to prevent local data movement.
.TP
\fB\fIdst_ds_array\fB\fR
A reference to an array of local data segments
describing the destination buffer for each member.
This parameter is only used at the root.
.TP
\fB\fIflags\fB\fR
A set of flags used to control the operation of
the work request.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This routine posts a collective work request to gather data from

the data.  The data segments describe the local send and/or receive
buffers.  Entries in the dst_ds_array specify the placement of data
received from each member.  Data is combined from each member in
ascending rank order.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
0
The work request was successfully posted.
.PP
E2BIG
The number of work request scatter gather elements exceed the
collective group configuration.
.PP
EACCES
The access rights of a local data segment do not allow local
read or write access as required.
.PP
EINVAL
An invalid parameter was provided.
.PP
ENOMEM
