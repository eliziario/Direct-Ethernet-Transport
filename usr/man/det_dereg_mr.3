A pointer to a registered memory region that will be

This routine deregisters a registered memory region.  The region
may be deregistered only if there are no memory windows bound to
the region.  Once this operation is complete, future accesses
using the memory region authorization keys will fail.  This call
is synchronous and may block until all references from the
underlying NIC are released.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"

0
The memory region was successfully deregistered.
.PP
EBUSY
The memory region has memory windows bound to it.
.PP
