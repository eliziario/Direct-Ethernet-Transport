.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.TP
\fB\fIco\fB\fR
A pointer to an existing collective group.
.TP
\fB\fIid\fB\fR
A 64-bit work request identifier that is returned
to the client as part of the work completion.
.TP
\fB\fIroot\fB\fR
The rank of the member providing the data.
.TP
\fB\fIsrc_ds_array\fB\fR
A reference to an array of local data segments
describing the source buffer for each member.
This parameter is only used at the root.
.TP
\fB\fIdst_ds\fB\fR
A reference to a local data segment describing the
destination buffer.  This parameter may be NULL at
the root to prevent local data movement.
.TP
\fB\fIflags\fB\fR
A set of flags used to control the operation
of the work request.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This routine posts a collective work request to scatter data to
all members.  The root parameter specifies the member providing
the data.  The data segments describes the local send and receive
buffers.  Entries in the src_ds_array specify the source data buffer
for each member.  Data is disbursed among members in ascending rank
order.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
0
The work request was successfully posted.
.PP
E2BIG
The number of work request scatter gather elements exceed the
collective group configuration.
.PP
EACCES
The access rights of a local data segment do not allow local
read or write access as required.
.PP
EINVAL
An invalid parameter was provided.
.PP
ENOMEM
There was insufficient memory to post the work request.
.PP
ENOSPC
The number of posted work requests exceed the current depth
available on the collective group.
.PP
ENOTCONN
The collective group state does not allow posting work requests.
.PP
ENXIO
The local authorization key of a data segment is invalid.
.PP
EPERM
The collective group and local data segment do not belong to
the same protection domain.
.PP
ERANGE
The specified virtual address and/or length of a data segment
exceed the memory region boundaries.
