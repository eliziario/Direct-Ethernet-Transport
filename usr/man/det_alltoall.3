.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.TP
\fB\fIco\fB\fR
A pointer to an existing collective group.
.TP
\fB\fIid\fB\fR
A 64-bit work request identifier that is returned
to the client as part of the work completion.
.TP
\fB\fIsrc_ds\fB\fR
A reference to a local data segment describing
the source buffer.
.TP
\fB\fIdst_ds\fB\fR
A reference to a local data segment describing
the destination buffer.
.TP
\fB\fIflags\fB\fR
A set of flags used to control the operation of
the work request.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This routine posts a collective work request to exchange data with
all group members.  The data segments describe the local send or
receive buffers.  The destination buffer must have read and write
access rights.  The transfer is divided by the size of the group.
Data is equally portioned to and combined from members in ascending
rank order.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
0
The work request was successfully posted.
.PP
EACCES
The access rights of a local data segment do not allow local
read or write access as required.
.PP
EINVAL
An invalid parameter was provided.
.PP
EIO
The local data segments do not describe memory that can be
evenly divided by the size of the collective group.
.PP
ENOMEM
There was insufficient memory to post the work request.
.PP
ENOSPC
The number of posted work requests exceed the current depth
available on the collective group.
.PP
ENOTCONN
The collective group state does not allow posting work requests.
.PP
ENXIO
The local authorization key of a data segment is invalid.
.PP
EPERM
The collective group and local data segment do not belong to
belong to the same protection domain.
.PP
ERANGE
