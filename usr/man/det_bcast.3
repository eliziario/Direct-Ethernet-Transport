.sp
int det_bcast  (struct det_co * const \fIco\fB, const __u64 \fIid\fB, const int \fIroot\fB, const struct det_local_ds * const \fIds\fB, const enum det_wr_flags \fIflags\fB);
\fR
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.TP
\fB\fIco\fB\fR
A pointer to an existing collective group.
.TP
\fB\fIid\fB\fR
A 64-bit work request identifier that is returned
to the client as part of the work completion.
.TP
\fB\fIroot\fB\fR
The rank of the broadcast root.
.TP
\fB\fIds\fB\fR
A reference to a local data segment.  If the root
is the calling node, the ds identifies the transmit
data, otherwise it specifes the receive buffer of
the broadcast.
.TP
\fB\fIflags\fB\fR
A set of flags used to control the operation
of the work request.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This routine posts a collective work request to perform a broadcast
from the root process to all other members.  The root parameter
specifies the member providing the data.  All other members will
receive the data.  The data segment describes either the local
send or receive buffer as determined by the root parameter.  The
data buffer must have read and write access rights.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
0
The work request was successfully posted.
.PP
EACCES
The access rights of the local data segment do not allow local
read and write access as required.
.PP
EINVAL
An invalid parameter was provided.
.PP
ENOMEM
There was insufficient memory to post the work request.
.PP
ENOSPC
The number of posted work requests exceed the current depth
available on the collective group.
.PP
ENOTCONN
The collective group state does not allow posting work requests.
.PP
ENXIO
The local authorization key of the data segment is invalid.
.PP
EPERM
The collective group and local data segment do not belong to
the same protection domain.
.PP
ERANGE
The specified virtual address and/or length of the data segment
exceed the memory region boundaries.
