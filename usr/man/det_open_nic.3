.SH NAME
det_open_nic \- 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB
.sp
int det_open_nic  (struct det_device * const \fIdetdev\fB, const char * const \fIifname\fB, const struct det_event * \fIevent\fB, struct det_nic * const \fInic\fB);
\fR
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.TP
\fB\fIdetdev\fB\fR
A pointer to an open instance of DET.
.TP
\fB\fIifname\fB\fR
A null-terminated string containing the name of the NIC
interface, limited to IFNAMSIZ bytes.
.TP
\fB\fIevent\fB\fR
A pointer to an event that is signaled after an asynchronous
event has occurred on the NIC.  This parameter is only valid
for user-mode clients.
.TP
\fB\fInic\fB\fR
Upon successful completion of this call, a pointer to the
opened NIC.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Opens a NIC for additional access.  A NIC must be opened before
any additional resources can be consumed.  When successful, this
routine returns a handle to an opened NIC.
.PP
For user-mode applications, a client specifies an event that will
be signaled when the NIC event occurs.  Any thread waiting on the
event will be used to notify the client through the event callback
specified when the event was created.  Use of the h_event parameter
permits a client thread to block, waiting on NIC, completion queue,
or user generated events.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
0
The operation was successful.
.PP
EINVAL
An invalid parameter was provided.  This return value only applies
to user-mode.
.PP
ENODEV
No NIC was found in the system with the specified \fIifname\fR\&.
.PP
ENOMEM
There was insufficient memory to open the NIC.
.PP
EPROTONOSUPPORT
The features of the NIC device interface are not sufficient to
support the DET protocol.
