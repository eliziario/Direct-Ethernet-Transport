.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.TP
\fB\fIco\fB\fR
A pointer to an existing collective group.
.TP
\fB\fIid\fB\fR
A 64-bit work request identifier that is returned
to the client as part of the work completion.
.TP
\fB\fIsrc_ds_array\fB\fR
A reference to an array of local data segments
describing the source buffer for each member.
.TP
\fB\fIdst_ds_array\fB\fR
A reference to an array of local data segments
describing the destination buffer for each member.
.TP
\fB\fIflags\fB\fR
A set of flags used to control the operation of
the work request.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This routine posts a collective work request to exchange data
with all group members.  The data segments describe the local
send and receive buffers.  Entries in the arrays specify the
number of local data segments exchanged with each member.  The
destination data buffers must have read and write access rights.
Data is combined from group members in ascending rank order.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
0
The work request was successfully posted.
.PP
E2BIG
The number of work request scatter gather elements exceed the
collective group configuration.
.PP
EACCES
The access rights of a local data segment do not allow local
read or write access as required.
.PP
EINVAL
An invalid parameter was provided.
.PP
ENOMEM
There was insufficient memory to post the work request.
.PP
ENOSPC
The number of posted work requests exceed the current depth
available on the collective group.
.PP
ENOTCONN
The collective group state does not allow posting work requests.
.PP
ENXIO
The local authorization key of a data segment is invalid.
.PP
EPERM
The collective group and local data segment do not belong to
belong to the same protection domain.
.PP
ERANGE
The specified virtual address and/or length of a data segment
exceed the memory region boundaries.
